## Etch-a-Sketch
Etch-a-Sketch/Sketchpad type drawing game.

## Description

Etch-a-sketch/sketchpad with a set of boxes that change to a random color whenever moused over. Each square will darken by 10% at every color change, so after 10 changes the square will be completely black. The reset button at the top takes user input and creates a new grid based on that choice (up to 100 by 100).

## Why?

The point of this project was to practice JavaScript, HTML, and CSS skills such as taking user input and then using that input to manipulate the DOM. It helped cement in how a simple page is set up with HTML, modified with JavaScript, and then how CSS can be used to add interesting effects like changing the color of the grid squares on hover. I thought it was particularly cool to make a resizable grid based off of user input, and to figure out how to use HSL colors to darken each square by 10% while still applying a new random color on each hover.
